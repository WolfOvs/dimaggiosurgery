<h3 class='title-article'>Soft-normal diet</h3>

You should be able to progress to a soft-normal diet 4 - 6 weeks after surgery.
<br><br>
<strong>What is a soft-normal diet?</strong><br><br>

A soft-normal diet involves gradually introducing more solid textures to your diet.
<br><br>
<strong>Suitable foods (in addition to the ones in a soft-sloppy diet) are:</strong><br><br>

<ul>
    <li>Soft minced meat</li>
    <li>Flaked fish without bones</li>
    <li>Well-cooked pulses</li>
    <li>Well cooked pasta</li>
    <li>Rice and vegetables with plenty of sauce</li>
</ul>

While you are having a soft-normal diet you should avoid the same foods you were advised to avoid on page 4.
<br><br>
If you have any difficulties with certain foods discuss this with your consultant or dietitian. At your 6 week follow-up appointment with your consultant you may agree with him/her that you should start a normal diet with more challenging textures.
<br><br>
<h3 class='title-article'>Having a balanced diet</h3>

It is important to have a well-balanced diet to give your body the right amount of energy, protein, vitamins and minerals to function properly. Choosing a variety of different foods will help you to get all the nutrients you need for good health. You also need to make sure your diet contains enough energy and protein as you may be eating less than usual.
<br><br>
Sometimes dietary changes can cause diarrhoea or constipation but this should settle once you are having a normal healthy diet. If you feel you are losing weight contact your hospital dietitian or ask your GP or practice nurse to refer you to a community dietitian.
